At this level, this looks like black magic. Why isn't the allocator dealing with all of this?

Happy to change this to whatever you suggest.
---

Well, I can move it into AllocateMemory but then the return type is still 

   std::aligned_storage<long expression, long expression>::type*

which is perfectly fine if you want me to change this to

   // Allocate well-aligned memory to store an ArtLambdaMethod.
   auto* uninitialized_lambda_method = lambda::LeakingAllocator::AllocateMemory<ArtLambdaMethod>(self);

or it could just use a void* but I find that loses the alignment and the size information which is problematic.

I suppose even in this case it might not even matter too much that if it was "auto*" since it gets used only for in-place new which works on any non-const void* (unfortunately there's no easy way to say non-const auto).

----
The real simple answer is that AllocateMemory can over-allocate (for structs that have a [0]sized array element, "flexible arrays") so I just wanted to reuse that same mechanism for allocating non-flexible structs.

In the end that whole class is going to go away so I didn't want to put too much thought into it, other than clearly marking every call site to be updated later.

What bothers me really is the alignment concerns. Why should allocation sites care about allocation alignments?

Well, I can move it to LeakingAllocator, not a problem.

-----

In general though doing a 

  new (some_ptr) T(...)

the alignof(*some_ptr) should be at least as much as alignof(T)

otherwise the in-place new is unsound (undefined behavior).

Feel free to specialize the operator new and ensure it's aligned. But I fail to see why call sites need to bother?

I was having some issues before when trying to stick it into the byte[], better be safe than sorry.

nit: this one the line above and the arguments each on their line?

This way is preferred because the arguments are aligned to the (

It's always preferable to align to the (, {, etc over doing a "i give up, so just wrap and indent 4 spaces" type of alignment.

As for something like

   var = foo(x,
             y,
             z)

That doesn't actually fit because the "= ..." part of the expression is pretty long.

I can update the guide if this was stated ambiguous earlier?

What I'm suggesting is:

init_lm = new () ArtLambdaMethod(
  called_method,
  captured,
  ...)

Why is it always preferable to align to the '('?

That's just the rule we have in the style guide, always align to the ( of the expression you are in if possible. 

The indent 4 spaces to the right thing is only when one of the args can't fit cause maybe the parameter name or the function name is too long.

Andreas wanted a consistent set of guidelines for how to indent and this provides a simple clear-cut "priority A,B,C" set of indentation rules.

No, clearly good taste is universal.
