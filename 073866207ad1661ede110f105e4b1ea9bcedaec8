"for a DexFile or OatFile location"? and then discuss the new subtle leading / stripping behavior?

I don't understand this comment.

My understanding of what the function does is this: given a dex location and the path of a dalvik cache directory, return the path to what the oat file should be named. This is done by turning the dex location into a file name (replacing '/' with '@' to get a valid filename), and adding '@classes.dex'. Does it do something different for the boot image?

After thinking some more, there is an ambiguity about what should happen if the dex location isn't absolute. Two sensible options are:
 1. Turn a relative dex location into an absolute dex location and form the oat file name from that.
 2. Treat a relative dex location as a separate dex location from the dex location corresponding to the absolute path of the relative dex location.

I had only thought of (2), not (1) when I posted this change. It seems a shame to add the work and complexity of (1) given that nobody uses relative dex locations. I'll have to think more about what I want to do here.

Thoughts?

the first half of the comment is just a nit about adding "location" to make it clear it is not a file path.

probably cache_location should be renamed to cache_directory to conversely make it clear it is expected to be a real path.

the second part about stripping leading / characters is because that seems to be part of the functional change to behavior in utils.cc

as far as relative dex locations, they used to work with dalvik. in fact i think there was some grossness that the art/tools/art script needs fully qualified instead of relative paths (and the old dalvik script did not). it is something we have lived without for a while, but it would make life easier to not have the limitation.

need cases for without leading / now as well.
