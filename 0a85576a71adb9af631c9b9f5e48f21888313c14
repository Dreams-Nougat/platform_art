I don't really see what's wrong with keeping this in thread.h though?

A lot of this information could be considered "helpers" for thread. Also I think semantically it's hard to know things like "NumStackReferences" is the sum of 2 other things.

Once more than a test is using this as a helper I'll agree. To me this is overhead in a *very* commonly included header.
