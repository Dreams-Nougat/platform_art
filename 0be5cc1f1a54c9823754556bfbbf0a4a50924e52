Pull these macros out into a common header? micro-native.h or common.h should suffice.

Too few, use 1000000 which is the same value as in the java file.

Also add an assert that it's the same thing as in the Java file.

I think it's missing one where it newlocalrefs in a loop then deletelocalrefs in a loop (I guess in reverse).

That's the more common case when using a bunch of "ScopedLocalRef" at the same scope

Naming wise I'd like to see it be called LocalRefs

If you are planning on adding global/weak refs to this file as well (and it certainly makes sense), then rename to IndirectRefs for most generality (and use the same prefix as the name of the java class containing the natives).

The java *benchmark* names should probably be something like UpcallRefLocalAdd, UpcallRefLocalAddRemove, etc.

Consider a few more cases with Push/Pop as it simulates the cost of multiple JNI transitions.

Could probably simple reuse some of the other functions (e.g. by calling a callback there which pushes/pops) by restructuring it a bit.

Put this into a common header?
