It's reserving a large set of bits for a very small number of "users." And it's not extensibly, there's a hard limit.

You mean the compiler for "users"? Yeah, though you could argue some other bits are also for a very small number of users.

Still we're talking about known methods, and most modifiers are not relevant for them.

What is the problem of using those bits, you think?

Hard limit is currently 255. We could work around using 65535 if you want to, but I doubt the intrinsic maintainer will survive that.

That's a bug that should be assigned to our class-unloading implementer...

Or a bug in the compiler. Regardless, we need to fix it, and I'm in the opinion avoiding a map completely is a nice cleanup.

Do you have other suggestions?
