Given that this method doesn't really exist, I suppose it's possible that we'd fail to verify it for that reason. How about changing this to a method that *does* exist but is not signature polymorphic ? MethodHandle.toString() maybe ?

general comment : these class names could have been more descriptive.

why /jumbo ? does it have any relevance to this test ?

Also, a brief comment here and on test() would be useful. Not looking for a detailed explanation, just an indication that this is your "test suite runner". Alternately, you could add a comment that has java source for these methods..

/jumbo was cut-and-paste (removed).

Added comment to main() and to the class definition and a reference to bug for dxmerge that forces this function to be written in smali.

Yes, it's a native method declaration.
