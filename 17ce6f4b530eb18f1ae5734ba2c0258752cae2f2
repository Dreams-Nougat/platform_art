You could remove the iterator here:
it = tagged_objects_.erase(it);

Premature optimization? If this change about just changing the data structure, could you do this optimization in a follow-up CL?

It's not premature if our GC people tell me they have concerns about the performance and keeping the contents of the table live. I'll split it into a separate CL, but I want this merged.

(Note that I should have tagged this RFC, it's mainly for shiufai to check the performance with his prototype. UpdateTable isn't yet implemented, as you may have seen.)
