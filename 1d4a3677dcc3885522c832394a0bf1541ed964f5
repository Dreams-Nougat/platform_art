nit: gets confusing later on in the code, why not just [boot_]class_path_element ?

nit: why is it called "from" ? Is there a tospace? I think just calling it image_locations would've been simpler.

This doesn't reset spaces_it to the beginning, can you comment the rationale here?

Should this have extra logic?

    error = error || ....

Otherwise it looks like the early error on 1721 might not proc because 1722/1723 makes this statement evaluate to always false?

Not really sure what the error conditions are, I think it has to have same # of components and same order right?
