For somebody not steeped in runtime internals like myself a bit more context and the behavior if the check fails in the commit comment would be nice. A bug number would also be good, if only so later issues / discussions / knowledge have somewhere obvious to go (and rollback record, if needed)

OTTOMH, there are a few classes in the wider libcore that use system properties that affect static initialization. I know you removed a few so that we can pre-initialize classes in the runtime but I don't think we've done all. It is conceivable that those system properties (or other things outside of our control / "hidden variables") could cause static initialization to fail.

Given it *expected* not to fail static initialization for boot classes but it *might* happen, should we start with a warning log instead? I'll happily confess I don't know the difference between a CHECK and DCHECK.
