Is there a way to make sure there are no suspend points in between? This is not safe if this pattern could occur:


x = LoadClass

thread suspension point

ClInitCheck(x)


Thread suspension could start GC and have the GC see a pointer in from-space of previous GC as a root.

Right. I don't know the answer to that.

This CL needs more thoughts.
