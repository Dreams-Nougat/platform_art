Maybe mention, that until know the "exact" flag on upper bounds was there for convenience
1) re-use of the same data structure
2) it was true because we mostly cared about HLoadClass as upper bounds which cannot be the outcome of a phi.

And that you need to change it because in the new use-case you want to check/force that the bound type has exactly the type of the upper bound.
