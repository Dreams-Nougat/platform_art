Do you know what caused the regression?

I strongly suspect it was when I reorganized type lookup tables out of DexFile.

Yes. David moved them to the OatDexFile, which doesn't exist during compilation.

I suggested both this solution and side tables in the class-linker to him as an alternative (and honestly I prefer the latter).

Side tables are annoying since you need a lock and stuff.

But the counterpoint is that now things return an OatDexFile (with a null OatFile) that didn't before - and it's not clear that you put DCHECKs at all those points...

The points are only for AOT compiler, most places don't need updating.
