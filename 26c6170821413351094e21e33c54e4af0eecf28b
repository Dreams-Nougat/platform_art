To me "If used in device mode" sounds a bit better, but not sure.

Add a comment that you're printing the pid of the shell and then invoking the comment. That PID is what you'll compare against when grepping for relevant output in the logcat.

Why do you kill it? Can't you use logcat -d?

logcat's buffers can overflow, -d is not robust because it doesn't get the logs live

OK, I guess we're expecting quite some logs here?

What prevents you from doing the TODO? Just adding a sleep is fine by now, and you can just say that another alternative would be to log more, but sleeping is just simpler.

Verbose compiler can be pretty verbose at times and I observed log loss with default device log buffer size. The reason for this is that logcat forgets old logs of components which would otherwise use a large portion of the log buffer. This prevents one component from monopolizing the shared buffer. It is described in more detail here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B1duaEbB5GHvz3_yBn3UccY5X9GIlINbWoi5svWaup8/edit#heading=h.mz05yb1xbi10 .

I will go ahead and add a sleep. The reason I don't want to dive into making this super robust is that I only have a couple days of my internship left and I would like to prioritize other tasks. As I mentioned this could very well be good enough as it worked for me every time so far.

sgtm. Again, just mentioning simplicity as a reason is fine enough. I generally dislike open-ended TODOs as they're discussion items more relevant in a bug than in code.
