OK, I see now (thanks for your example!)

Seems to me this should be relative to the basic block size? How about we don't increment the count when the simplification involves merging two instructions into one?

That variable was to avoid the infinite loop. If the simplification involves removing one instruction, we know we cannot fall into that situation.
