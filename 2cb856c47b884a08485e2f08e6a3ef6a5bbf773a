While you're at it:

String checks are yuck, because I don't think we forbid redefining those in a custom classloader. So please add a that class_loader==null. (I see that the copy in reflection.cc is also wrong in this aspect...)

This turned out to be pretty awkward. When I wrote this function, I was looking for a way to just do an == check with some Class* somewhere (i could have sworn i saw these in well known classes or some-such) but couldn't find any.

I'll add a class loader check. Can i do it in the follow up change, because i might be able to share more code with reflection.cc with a slightly larger change.
