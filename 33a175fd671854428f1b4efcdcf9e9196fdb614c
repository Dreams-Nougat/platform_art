Should this line be in arm64/instruction_set_features_arm64.h as well?

It looks like you can get it from instruction_set_features.h. I don't know what style we prefer in terms of re-including <memory> everywhere a unique_ptr is used. I think it's okay to remove the <memory> include here.

Do you need std::move here? Can't you just return FromCppDefines() directly?
