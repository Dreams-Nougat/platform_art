Should this line be in arm64/instruction_set_features_arm64.h as well?

It looks like you can get it from instruction_set_features.h. I don't know what style we prefer in terms of re-including <memory> everywhere a unique_ptr is used. I think it's okay to remove the <memory> include here.

I think this was a bit overzealous (and not consistent of me). For STL it doesn't matter too much.

For our own include files, our long-term goal is include-what-you-use - so mostly no transitive includes. That makes dependencies clearer...

Do you need std::move here? Can't you just return FromCppDefines() directly?

It's not, it's a bit overzealous.

Overzealous.
