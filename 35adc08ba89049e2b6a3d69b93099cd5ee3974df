I'd prefer you hide this in the cc file. There's not a large benefit of keeping the field a non-pointer, and this way the vixl headers pollute the main disassembler file.

The actual disassembly is:

 f24010ff	mov r0, #511

In other words, T3 encoding, and 511 can't be represented in both T1 or T2.

In the manual, the T3 encoding is shown as

  MOVW<c> <Rd>, #<imm16>

Why isn't vixl disassembling it as "movw"?

Yeah, I got this test wrong. Can you move the "MOVS ., #0" to line 118 as CHECK-NEXT, please? It looks pretty confusing the way it is now.

(Optimization opportunity: allow HAnd to generate UBFX. Then the 511 can be embedded.)

Why? This is changing the test spec.

Not exactly. Here is the original disassembly before this change:

 24010ff       movw    r0, #511
 2100          movs    r1, #0
 ea820000      eor.w   r0, r2, r0
 ea830101      eor.w   r1, r3, r1
 4770          bx      lr

As you can see, the only reason the test passed is because the second eor instruction has the ".w" suffix, and the checker rule on line 220 (in the original) looks just for "eor" (contrary to the previous rule). The new disassembler drops the suffix, hence the test fails, although nothing has changed in the generated code.

I am not sure what the exact intention behind the rule on line 220 is, but it seems that the test case should be fixed/improved, which I'd rather do in a separate patch. Here you just see the quick change that makes the test pass.

Yeah, there's plenty of CHECK-NOTs that are missing the "{{(\.w)?}}". So, they are not really checking what they should.

Why does the vixl disassembler omit the ".w"? It's explicit in the manual, for example

    EOR{S}.W <Rd>, <Rn>, <Rm>{, <shift>}

I am still a little bit puzzled by this test. What's the intention? That there are a couple of MOVs followed by exactly two EORs? So, would the following work (using pre-ARMv8 syntax):

 /// CHECK-START-ARM: long Main.xor511(long) disassembly (after)
 /// CHECK:                movw {{r\d+}}, #511
 /// CHECK-NEXT:           movs {{r\d+}}, #0
 /// CHECK-NOT:            eor{{(\.w)?}}
 /// CHECK:                eor{{(\.w)?}} {{r\d+}}, {{r\d+}}, {{r\d+}}
 /// CHECK-NEXT:           eor{{(\.w)?}} {{r\d+}}, {{r\d+}},{{r\d+}}
 /// CHECK-NOT:            eor{{(\.w)?}}

The current disassembler has the limitation that all immediate operands have to be printed either signed or unsigned, so we have decided to be consistent with LLVM, and to print unsigned. However, we do realize that the best format depends on instruction type (e.g. signed for addition, but unsigned for bitwise operations), so the VIXL team is considering extending the disassembler.

The actual disassembly is:

 f04f31ff	mov r1, #-1

In other words, T2 encoding outside an IT block.

The ARM ARM makes specifying the destination register optional if it is the same as the immediately following it source register.

The actual disassembly is:

 ea417192	orr r1, r2, lsr #30

In other words, T2 encoding outside an IT block.

Sorry, I meant 2051.
