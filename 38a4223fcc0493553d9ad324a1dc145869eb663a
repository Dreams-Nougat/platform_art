I don't know about everyone else, but I was under the impression people use these functions a lot directly from gdb. I know I certainly do.

It's much easier to remember to use Art::Pretty?? and look into utils.h when debugging then having to dig across 10 different files.

So I would recommend leaving these here even if it just calls the code in the new refactored locations, it will make debugging easier.
