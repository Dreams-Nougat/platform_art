Why is this limitation there?

What I don't understand is what exactly is it supposed to do if it's --no-build?

If it doesn't make a build then how exactly is it supposed to use the prebuild artifacts? If it's reusing them from the last run then I think an argument that passes the temp dir from before (from a run with --never-clean) would be more clear.
