Change the arena to something passed as parameter? I think this change is very close to what I intende. Maybe I'd prefer Linearize to be a static method that takes a graph and an allocator, and returns an ArenaVector, but won't push for it.

That is actually what I was moving to as well, since it still has allocation from the global arena. But at this point, I made it a TODO and will do this after this loop CL if you don't mind.

I also have some more ideas to do the same phase local heap memory for some of the induction data structures.
