Why don't we simply pass the VerifierDeps as an extra parameter to VerifyClass()? That way we can avoid the extra member in Thread and a lot of indirections in the VerifierDeps. Repeatedly retrieving the VerifierDeps singleton just to compare it with null for the non-AOT case isn't exactly free.

We would need to rewrite the ParallelCompilationManager a bit to provide a worker id to Visit(), so that we can pass the right per-thread VerifierDeps.
