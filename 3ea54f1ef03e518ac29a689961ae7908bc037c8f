Does that mean vixl only reserve D31? I'm surprised we didn't hit this before.

That is correct.
There is not much need for FP temp registers in the macro assembler.

Sure, but I'm surprised we are only starting to hit the case described by Roland below ("within a ParallelMove instruction, when a move is blocked by a another move")

Actually I would be interested in the backtrace. Because here the temp is only used locally. So it means the move is emitted within a scope that already has taken the temp reg.
