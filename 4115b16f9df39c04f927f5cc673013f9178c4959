btw, this seems awkward. i initially assumed it was an out arg but it's not - shouldn't we pass it as an in-arg by const reference (and make VerifierDeps::Encode const ?)

It can be null (for eg the boot image, which doesn't need verifier deps), hence the pointer.

second half of the message is still valid (can be const verifier::VerifierDeps* verifier_deps).

I don't know how much of the google3 style guide you follow, but in-args must come before out-args according to that.

There's no out args here. I think you're being confused by the 'out' in the parameter name, but that's a file where we are going to dump stuff to (for the oat file, we actually just call it 'out').

And the style I think we've always followed is only use const references.
