I'm ok if you want to keep it but from the PM/installd point of view what's the difference between this one on kDex2OatForFilter? Wouldn't it execute the same dex2oat command?

Perhaps use of the vdex file could differ? If the filter changed, it may mean more information should be added to the vdex file. If you know the filter did not change, you know you don't need to change the vdex file at all?

vdex should be filter independent. Or at least it is now.

I'm ok having a more refine status even if we'd end up using the same dex2oat command later. It gives us more flexibility I guess.
