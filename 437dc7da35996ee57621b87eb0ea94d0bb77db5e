is this a good example? I guess it technically doesn't overwrite the input because that is technically in /system/framework/<isa>/boot.oat

The output of symbolize is determined by --output, defaulting to 'symbolized.oat'.

The reason I ran into this was because I wanted to add symbols to /data/dalvik-cache/arm/system@framework@boot.oat. I could use that instead if you think it's a better example.

But, now that you mention it, I should update the rest of the usage info to say you can run 'oatdump --symbolize' without an oat-file or image in this case.

ah, i would have expected --oat-file= --output= and --symbolize to really just change the dumping mode. we don't document the symbolized.oat behavior anywhere that i can see.

Yeah, that's my bad. I chose symbolized.oat to *not* have to overwrite the original, and have a somewhat meaningful name.

I'd suggest extending the usage info to make clear that --output is kind-of expected.
