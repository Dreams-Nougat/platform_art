Where is the support for this?

Looks like I missed the ?=.  I can add it back to art.go if you want, although I think it is easier to just change the value in build/Android.bp.  In any case, this line isn't doing anything now.

The ? was important, it made everything easy to change without having to revert changes etc. I'd prefer for you to put this back in, but maybe I'm the only one.

(I know it's not doing anything, I -1-ed so that there's a discussion before any trace goes away...)
