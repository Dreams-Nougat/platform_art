Any reason not to use else-if here? Slightly easier to read.

I thought this was a little clearer, especially with the comment on line 127-128. I see these as three cases, one of which has two sub-cases.

The three cases are :
(1) both references.
(2) both primitives
(3) one reference and one primitve.

does that make sense ?
