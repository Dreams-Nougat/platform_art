Can you split these out to separate CL(s)? (Not related or only remotely related to the HInvokeStaticOrDirect.)

Yes, there should be a MIPS64 implementation as well (when we're done with the MIPS32 round).

The question is whether this particular class adds some value to the intended mips64 implementation.

I believe the DexCacheArraysBase optimization is as useful on MIPS64 as it is on MIPS32. I guess, we could indeed fold MipsBaseRelativePatcher into MipsRelativePatcher and use the that same class for both MIPS32 and MIPS64 and simply invoke the constructor a bit differently so that MipsRelativePatcher::is_r6 is initialized with true on MIPS64. Is this what you're asking about?

No, that's not what I was asking about, but if it makes sense to share the implementation to such extent, you could merge it all to one class.

As it stands now, this class seems to add very little value to both mips and mips64. If you intend to add more shared code to this class (say, PatchCall()) but still keep some things separated, then it makes sense to keep it as is.

Could you please elaborate? My current implementation of VisitInvokeStaticOrDirect() adds at most one additional input register, which is either the base for PC-relative literals (needed for k*WithFixup) or the base for the dex cache array (needed for kDexCachePcRelative). It won't work with a combination of, say, kDexCachePcRelative and kCallDirectWithFixup because they'd need two different input registers. Which is why I put a CHECK() below to catch this in case it happens (haven't seen so far). Do I need to do anything about the implementation or is your comment only about my comment? Or are you, in fact, confirming that kDexCachePcRelative and kCallDirectWithFixup can't (or shouldn't) ever come together? IOW, what do you want me to do here?

Yes, I'm just saying that I don't see any reason why the sharpening should ever ask for kDexCachePcRelative+kCallDirectWithFixup. So, your code should be fine. (Nothing to do here.)

I've found a statement in the documentation that says that RA is updated before the instruction in the delay slot. So, that's already happening (there's no NOP between NAL and MOVE).

Why?

I'm always cautious. But if the documentation says it's OK, than we can do it.

We can do it in some but not all cases. 64-bit accesses broken down into pairs of 32-bit accesses need offset and offset + 4. On the caller side I may be unable to add the 4 in the 16 least-significant bits of the offset (e.g. 0x7ffc + 4) because the offset in LW and SW is int16_t (0x7ffc + 4 overflows into the negative range to -0x8000). This is why in the general case the 32-bit offset is first loaded in its entirety into a register after which we can always do e.g. LW reg, 0(reg) or LW reg, 4(reg).

I didn't feel like complicating the code at this time by bringing in the type accessed (64-bit double vs 64-bit long vs everything else) and moving the existing callers' logic into this method.

Doesn't 64-bit access need to be 8B-aligned? And with the base register presumably 8B-aligned, offset 0xfffc is illegal?

Yes, we must have aligned accesses on R2 and we prefer to have them aligned on R6 as well. The problem is that they aren't always aligned. For instance, as I indicated it a long time ago, CodeGenerator::InitializeCodeGeneration() does not care to align 64-bit things within the frame, however the frame size is guaranteed to be a multiple of 8 bytes.

This brings up a question. While the locations of non-callee-saves within the frame are controlled by the common part of the code generator, the code generator probably doesn't care about the exact locations of callee-saves so long as they occupy the same region at the top of the frame. If so (I haven't tried it yet), I could swap callee-saved FPU regs with callee-saved GPRs in CodeGenerator*::GenerateFrameEntry()/GenerateFrameExit() to guarantee 64-bit alignment for callee-save doubles on MIPS32. Do you think it'd work and I should go for it?

Same as above. I may be unable to add 4 while staying within the bounds of the 16 least-significant bits of the offset.

It's really weird to call these "conditions." The branch type should be sufficient to distinguish the labels.

I agree it looks a bit weird now. The idea was that similarly to generating different conditional branches based on the condition we'll choose between e.g. lw and lwc1 for literals. OTOH, since PC-relative addressing on R6 is available for GPR loading only, different instruction sequences will be needed for literals of different types and we'll indeed have to use different "branch types" as you say. So, I guess, I could use some kind of kFakeLiteralCond here. How about that?

I think storing kUncond in Branch::branch_condition_ should be just fine. You don't have to read it at all if you first check the Branch::type_. And you should create a different constructor for literals instead of trying to make the old one conform to a new use case.
