It's not obvious reading the code that these states are disjoint. The reading I have is we have the following states:

A. No Image File Found
B. Image File Found
In the case where an image file is found, the image that is found can have the following properties:
 1. The checksum is or is not up to date.
 2. The image has or has not been relocated (only relevant if the checksum is up to date).
 3. The image is or is not for the preferred abi.

Then we have the following cases:
1. No image file found (kImageUnusable)
2. Preferred image found with up-to-date checksum and relocated (kImageUsable)
3. Preferred image found with up-to-date checksum but not relocated (kImageNeedsRelocation). The comment claims this can only happen for system images. Is that because all other images are assumed to already be relocated? Or is it because you can't relocate the system image? If it's the later, it seems like the real question we are asking is not "what is the state of the image", but rather, "what should we do to make the image up to date". Maybe choosing different names based on that idea would make this more understandable.
4. Preferred image found, but it's not up to date. (kImageOutOfDate? Though presumably an out-of-date image is also unusable?)
5. No preferred image found, but a non-preferred image was found that is up to date and relocated (kImageNotPreferred).
6. No preferred image found, but a non-preferred image was found that is up to date, but not relocated. (kImageNotPreferred? kImageNeedsRelocation? kImageUnusable?)

They are not totally disjoint. 

kImageUnusable is only returned for images that are corrupt or missing. all other states mean the image could be used but the runtime would not pick it for various reasons.

kImageNeedsRelocation will only be returned for /system images. If the /system image would be preferred we would never return this.

What does this parameter do?

My interpretation is if relocation_needed is True, this does the same as GetSelectedImageInfo(), otherwise this may return the info for a system image that hasn't been relocated, even if relocation is enabled. In that case, maybe have two distinct functions: 'GetRelocatedImageInfo()' for when relocation_needed is true, and 'GetUpToDateImageInfo()' for when relocation_needed is false.

If you aren't caching anything, why have an ImageAssistant class? Instead just use static functions, passing the location and isa manually every time.

What's wrong with that? It's pretty common to have classes that are all-const in the fields (in art). Sometimes the functions can have side-effects on the parameters (I suppose in this case it doesn't, beyond regular out-params), or it's just a helper class.

My understanding behind this CL was that the whole intention was to refactor the previous situation of "use static functions and pass parameters every time" into a helper class.

Which this CL seems to have successfully accomplished.

Given the name of the class "ImageAssistant", I assume the ImageAssistant is meant to be analogous to the OatFileAssistant.

The goal of the OatFileAssistant was to avoid duplicating the  code for checking the status of an oat file. Previously there were multiple copies across the code base of the code for checking the status of an oat file, each with minor variations. The reason the OatFileAssistant is a class, rather than a set of static functions, is because providing static functions without duplicating code would require the same expensive operations to be executed multiple times in many of the use cases. The OatFileAssistant is a cache for those expensive operations. (From a Haskell point of view: lazy evaluation improves modularity; the OatFileAssistant is a localized implementation of lazy evaluation to improve the modularity of getting the status of an oat file).

In the ImageAssistant case, it doesn't appear that you need to introduce a kind of lazy evaluation for modularity, and it would be simpler and easier to understand if you provided static functions instead.

Or maybe the issue is that the ImageInfo class is the cache. Then remove the extra class definition and rename the ImageInfo class ImageAssistant.

Thanks for the interesting viewpoint :). I don't have a strong opinion against this FWIW.

----

If the issue is that it is too similar to ImageAssistant, what if he just renames it to something else like ImageFileHelper, or pretty much anything with +Image -Assistant. That might be the easiest fix.

On the other hand, if it was purely static helpers do you envision every function with 2 extra arguments?

  ImageFileHelper::GetSelectedImageInfo(location, isa)

?

That might be a little verbose for a lot of different calls, and it becomes really tempting to fabricate isa from kRuntimeISA. I suppose if it was one arg that might be fine.

  ImageLocation image_location(location, isa);
  // Option A:
  ImageFileHelper::GetSelectedImageInfo(image_location);
  // Option B: I suppose it could also be a free function,
  GetSelectedImageFileInfo(image_location);


This seems like it could be an OK-ish change, though definitely not the kind of code I would normally write.

Option A is still a few more characters to read though than what it was already doing today. Option B makes it significantly harder to find the source code where the function is actually declared without grepping.

  ImageAssistant image_assistant(location, isa);
  image_assistant.GetSelectedImageInfo();

One thing that might help to note is that ImageAssistant is immutable (perhaps we should even change all the local variables to 'const ImageAssistant image_assistant' to make it more obvious), which is a pretty common design pattern in OO-like languages that lack purity.

In regards to modularity, just separating out code into separate classes usually reduces tight coupling and increases cohesion (think object-oriented design). I'm not sure if lazy evaluation is meant to traditionally affect modularity, it's usually used as a correctness (can't eagerly evaluate if it's too early, e.g. no runtime yet) or as a performance (re-evaluation is expensive, e.g. disk reads) feature.

For statics vs non-static methods that do the same thing, i.e.

  static void foo(Type& t, ... Args);
  void foo(... Args);

There is indeed very little difference other than the syntax, basically the call-site (and declaration) becomes much larger to read/write, hurting code readability. Instance methods (syntactically) are just generally preferred over static methods if their semantics are identical, am happy to explain more offline as this is a more philosophical discussion without a concretely right/wrong answer.

Just to defend my current design.

There are a few places (most notably patchoat) where the fact that ImageAssistant is a class is helpful. It allows one to write functions that pick between a cache and system image in a different manner without having to pass around the location and isa all the time.

Furthermore if we wanted to make ImageInfo not be a class we would need to have everything pass around both the system and cache image filenames (or recalculate them every time) due to the way that status checking works which would be very confusing.

Also this was mainly designed to pull all the different logics we use to choose images into one single place and allow one to easily implement slightly different logics if need be. This is because none of the operations involved in choosing an art file are particularly expensive. We could change it in the future to be caching if it becomes so however.

It is, if this returns false then the state will be kImageUnusable (or kImageOutOfDate on a cache image if a valid /system image exists).
