I thought about it yesterday and I realized this change is probably incorrect, or an undesirable hack at best.  I think the only reason I added it was to keep heap poisoning configurations work with this CL on x86 and x86-64, where the (Baker) read barrier status is "implicitly" stored in EFLAGS/RFLAGS, thus delaying the unpoisoning of loaded references after the gray-testing (see https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/261232/5/compiler/optimizing/code_generator_x86.cc).

The obvious solution is to materialize the read barrier state into a register in the `HLoadReadBarrierState` instruction on x86 and x86-64 (as we already do on ARM and ARM64), meaning we can also get rid of the `HMarkReferencesImplicitRBState` instruction (and rename `HMarkReferencesExplicitRBState` to something shorter such as `HMarkReferences`).  This also seems more robust regarding evolutions of this work, where we would permit more instructions between the `HLoadReadBarrierState` and `HMarkReferences` instructions, which would alter the flags register (e.g. arithmetic instructions).
