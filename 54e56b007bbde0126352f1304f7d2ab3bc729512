I think this should be "... == nullptr || ... " as the nullptr case is the string constructor.

But given we're checking th einput line 1902, that shouldn't really matter.

Which makes me think we probably want a IsStringConstructor on HInvokeStaticOrDirect.

no, I think we really want a != nullptr test (we want a constructor on stringbuffer)

let me see if I can make a regression test

I know we want a consturctor on StrigBuffer, that's the reason for my other comment "But given we're checking th einput line 1902, that shouldn't really matter :)

I was just arguing about the conformity of checking whether it's a constructor call.

But we can stop this discussion. Sorry to have brought it up :)
