WrongMethodTypeException.

(On the other hand I don't see the usefulness of these comments. They're just repeating the method names).

Done. I'm following the organization of the rest of this header file. Think of this as a section header for all functions that throw WrongMethodTypeExceptions (see line 182)

I'd be good to have a way to prevent any uses after that line of callsite_type and target_type. Mathieu just added the ObjPtr API, maybe it's easy to hook that in?

(To expand on this a bit more, i'm using Handles for a lot of these things now since there are a few places the thread could get suspended here and above, for example while resolving a method type or when performing a boxing conversion. We can revisit this later if it turns out to be a performance issue.

The only AssertNoThreadSuspension here is one that covers the creation of a shadow frame, and that's present in all other places where the SF is created as well.)
