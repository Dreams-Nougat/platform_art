I don't understand why you need to do it this way. Why don't you iterate over the dex registers, get their location and then do a bitmask check on the register stack or stack mask?

Because I wanted to keep most of the code common between Precise and NonPrecise.

Walking the dex registers alone will not work if the compiler has reference temporaries.
