We should also make it clear in the comment it's in the loop header only. Since other loop blocks may not be executed. Loop header also rules out that the can-throw instruction can move in front of a try boundary within the loop, since try boundary introduces additional blocks so the can-throw instruction can't be in the loop header. So it rules out something like:
try {
  int i = 0;
  do {
    try {
      i = 1;    // even though there is no field store, following NullCheck should not be hoisted.
    } catch(Exception e) {}
  } while (arr.length < 10)
} catch (Exception e) {}

Actually if we have:
i = 0;
try {
  do {
      i = 1;    // even though there is no field store, following NullCheck should not be hoisted.
  } while (arr.length < 10)
} catch (Exception e) {}

That still doesn't look right. Do we guard against this case? Looks like the whole thing can't be in a try block.

This test isn't very future-proof. The StaticFieldSet could be hoisted and then the NullCheck+ArrayLength would be hoisted as well. Maybe we should add something like "j = (j+3)^2" and change the store to "sA = j".

StaticFieldSet can't move so it won't be hoisted.
I tried yesterday to have other patterns and it's quite difficult to allow the NullCheck to be hoisted since it's easy to introduce loop_effects that NullCheck depends on.

Non-volatile StaticFieldSet that always stores the same value and is executed at least once is a perfect candidate for hoisting if there are no other writes to memory observable by other threads. (Not by the current LICM though.)
