if you are going to move it, move it to its own file?

I just moved it up, as it's now used in a different method. I assumed it was just local to ClassLinker and should then stay that way.

I am assuming that the caller has a local vector. That seems reasonable to me. I don't see a reason why the vector should be shared across threads.

The rollback is for cases like dex2oat, which reads all inputs into a "big" vector. In those cases I don't want "half" of a multidex in there if we fail.

here is an example where I think we need to use all

consider people that use multi-dex to combined separately built dex files, the first one may not change when others are updated.

I thought it added unnecessary complexity to add multidex scanning to the open-oat-file code. Instead I optimistically take the file and try to "multidex-open" it, and see if it fails the checksums then. If it does, it will try to regenerate.

What might be wrong is me not closing the oat file I opened in step 2) when multidex-loading fails.

In this case, the oat file has already been opened. That is why it is found. There is no "ownership" here.

in all of these, the dex_location is the container right, which is why there is still a one-to-one mapping from dex to oat?

however, shouldn't there be more than one dex_location_checksum. seems unsafe to assume just classes.dex matters. we could sum the checksums of all to keep things simple.

As mentioned in the corresponding .cc part, I thought the added complexity is not worth it, and the Open code will take care of checking the other checksums.

I made all these methods, as far as I could, private, so they are not exposed to anything outside ClassLinker. Thus it should not be able to be abused.

As seen below, the input to OpenDexFile is a simplified "name," and GetDexFileName does some translation. I left it structurally the way I found it (and it's the only "real" user of GetDexFileName in all tests), but I could refactor the functionality fully to CommonRuntimeTest (where GetDexFileName already lives).

unique_ptr (and init on one line).

we always want to free. from libdvm code:

    /*
     * We can't just free arbitrary DEX files because they have bits and
     * pieces of loaded classes.  The only exception to this rule is if
     * they were never used to load classes.
     *
     * If we can't free them here, dvmInternalNativeShutdown() will free
     * them when the VM shuts down.
     */

so the point is, the runtime has the ownership, so we can delete what is not registered, then delete the container. 

so the loop can just null out what is registered, then call the usual helper to delete the rest of the container contents.

The description likely doesn't hold, but here are my assumptions, in descending order of importance:
(1) Type ids are sorted, and so are classes in a dex file. It might never have been explicit, but I thought the array we returned would be sorted, too.
(2) Storage space is constrained. Set has lower requirements than unordered_set.
(3) I thought the implementation is not that bad and iterating over a larger backing array in unordered_set would make up for the tree costs. That might not be true.

I worry about cases where we look with location and not also dex_location_checksum. you need to test with apps like https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eclipsim.gpsstatus2 that use the same location more than once in the same runtime with different checksums.

I should have likely just used the function below with nullptr.

There is a reason for this, but it's likely too contrived to be realistic. It was to allow secondaries without checksums, but keep the loading code minimal (shared over "oat found" and "oat regenerated").

this is only used for .odex next to container. location will never be a "multi-dex" name

The method is "public," so I was erring on the side of safety.

Forgot to document this in the commit message. Two things:
(1) I like enum classes (type safety FTW), and the tool didn't handle them.
(2) After I made the change, I realized that the enum was private (as it's only used in private methods), so auto-generation will fail. So I added parsing a "  // private" comment to skip generating << code.
