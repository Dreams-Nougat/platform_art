This is against style rules.

Without this `using`, `vixl::aarch64::` becomes very invasive.
I felt this might be an acceptable trespassing:
- The `using` is in the namespace `art::arm64`, so does not leak out to other backends.
- ARM64 code including this header likely will deal with code-generation and also use VIXL.
Does it sound reasonable to you? Up to you.

Looks like Scott did the change? Looking at PS3, maybe just "using namespace vixl" would be ok for me. But maybe not worth trsspassing the style?

I did.

Do you want me to use "using namespace vixl" in the header files, even though it's against your style rules? I think a using directive in the headers is neater, but as Andreas points out, it's against your rules.

How do you want me to do it?

It's fine as it is now.

How invasive is it compared to the current state of affairs?

Maybe we could consider introducing a namespace alias:

  namespace vixl64 = vixl::aarch64;

?

I'll leave this for now, as agreed offline.
