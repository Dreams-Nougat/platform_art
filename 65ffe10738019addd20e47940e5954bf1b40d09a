Do we need to use the expensive PrettyMethod()?

We could put together hashes from the name, argument types and return type without translating "Lpackage/Class;" to package.Class, "I" to "int", etc., and without doing heap allocations for the std::string.

See comment on PS1. I'd rather keep this simple for now. I think we can get a factor of 3 or so faster (just taking Compute...(GetDeclaringClassDescriptor()) takes 10% of this), but we'll still be three orders of magnitude slower. Is a follow-up OK with you?

I want to try Hash(classname) + method_index, which would lose some stability (wrt/ methods in the interface), but should stay at the 10% mark.
