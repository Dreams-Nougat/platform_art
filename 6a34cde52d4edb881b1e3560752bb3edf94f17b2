Not sure I understand this check. Is it for checking the last visited range is owned by this interval?

I added this mostly for myself to make sure I wasn't iterating over a sibling's list when I assigned the cached range to the correct sibling during a split. Doing that gained nothing so I just cleared the cached value but the check stayed. You might be right that it's slightly too paranoid. Want me to get rid of it?

It's OK to keep it, but it deserves a comment.

So we go back to first range if the position is below the last visited range. If we knew the places we restart the algorithm, we wouldn't need to check right?

That's assuming Covers is always called on non-decreasing sequences. For example, FreeIfNotCover is called on current_pos+1 and ConnectSplitSiblings calls Covers completely out of sequence. 

So yes, we could get rid of it but apart from "resetting" the cached value of each interval, we would also have to rewrite some bits to run in the correct order and I'm worried I might miss something.

Please add a comment on this code then, explaining that "even though it is linear, ....".
