In my understanding, here FUTEX_WAIT wants a relative timeout, but we give it an absolute timeout.
In futex(2) man page:
 Note: for FUTEX_WAIT, timeout is interpreted as a relative
              value.  This differs from other futex operations, where
              timeout is interpreted as an absolute value.  To obtain the
              equivalent of FUTEX_WAIT with an absolute timeout, employ
              FUTEX_WAIT_BITSET with val3 specified as
              FUTEX_BITSET_MATCH_ANY.

See how bionic uses FUTEX_WAIT_BITSET at https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bionic/+/master/libc/private/bionic_futex.h
