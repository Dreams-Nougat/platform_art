Didn't this already have the "Too many open files" in the error message?

I suppose it might've been unclear that it was the JNIEnv allocation that was failing though (to non-Art developers)?

This put the "Too many open files" in a LOG message. The goal of my change is to instead propagate that error to the exception message that is thrown at the Java level when we fail to create the JNIEnv.
