I was wondering whether we needed a DMB ISH barrier here (and one after the loop, on line 780), but because we're implementing a strong CAS with relaxed memory ordering, I thought they were not needed.  (Clang seems to generate similar code, without DMBs, for such a strong relaxed CAS).  Is this a valid assumption?
