i'm not sure i understand this. this would make all var-arg native methods signature polymorphic ? Even things like this from android.util.EventLog:


 public static native int writeEvent(int tag, Object... list);

we need to verify that VRegH is in the right range at a lower level in the verifier (hard verifier failure if not).
