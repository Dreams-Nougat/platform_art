Vladimir, Calin: this code review includes the two ways we could approach this.

The code below is option 1, mimicing the side effects of invoking WriteDexFiles.

The code line 538 is option 2, where we pass 'actually_write' to the helper methods.

Let me know which way you prefer. option 2 pollutes the helper methods, while option 1 duplicates logic.

I don't have a strong preference.

We chatted offline. Option 2, with passing a flag to the helper methods seems cleaner (together with a rename on 'actually_write'. maybe 'update_vdex_inplace' or anything else along these lines).
