Might be nice to have it guarded by a global constant here.

Definitely add a comment with a FIXME and a bug#.

It's the local IRT bug that is tracking this, that's why it's listed in the commit message.

I don't want to add a constexpr when it's not working at all the other way around. Instead I factored this to be minimal, so that it can be easily reverted.
