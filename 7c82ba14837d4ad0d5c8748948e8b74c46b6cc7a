Not sure about that subject: we don't change how we *report* the exception but how we *detect* when we need to report the exception. It's more about getting rid of  the is_exception_reported_to_instrumentation_ flag from Thread, it's more a cleanup.

I'd change to something like "Change detection of exception reporting to the debugger"

This is an issue, at least for interpreter. We handle the exception in the "caller" (the method that called the native method). There the thread's current method is "caller". If the top method of the exception's stack is the "native" method, the test will always return false and we'll never report the exception.

I think it works if we consider the exception's top non-native method (aka the caller of the native method).
