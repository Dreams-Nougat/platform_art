The stack trace includes CollectGarbageInternal but not this function?

I think surrounding ClampGrowthLimit with ScopedGCCriticalSection may be cleaner rather than GC always holding the clamp_growth_limit_GC_lock_ while running a GC. As ClampGrowthLimit only happens once per app launch, I think it's fine.
