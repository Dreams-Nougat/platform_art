Is the LLVM rebase ready? Do we need to set the topic?

Alternatively, is there perhaps a version check we can do for this, so that this CL can be submitted before the LLVM rebase?

The rebase isn't ready yet, so I don't have a topic for the switchover yet. I am testing the new compiler, but it isn't an official build.

We don't set version numbers in any reasonable way to handle this (and I don't want to start depending on that in any case). This will just have to wait.
