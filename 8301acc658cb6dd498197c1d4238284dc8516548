Just to make you aware that this filter will be considered to be "better" than kSpeed. See "AsGoodAs" method. That it, if something is compiled layout-profile and you use 'adb shell package compile..." with speed, nothing will be done.  Probably not a problem, but it's something you should keep in mind in your tests.
