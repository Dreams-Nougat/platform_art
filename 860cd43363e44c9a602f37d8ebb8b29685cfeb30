for most of the null returns below this point :

Do we have a pending exception when Get() == nullptr here ? These are serious issues and we should either throw an exception or abort the VM.

If there's a pending exception, you might want to mark these as UNLIKELY

just an observation: this is an odd mix of public JNI API and internal runtime API. you're using env->NewObject and then soa.Decode<> on that object. can't say OTTMH if there's a better way.

also, i don't understand the push & pop of the local frame. isn't popping the local frame equivalent to calling env->DeleteLocalRef after you Set ? (i'm sure i missed something, but i'm waiting for you to tell me what :) )
