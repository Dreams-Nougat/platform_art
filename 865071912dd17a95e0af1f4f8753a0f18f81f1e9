Reaching into and parsing part of the compiler arguments seems like a bad idea.

We've debated the same thing last release too about compiler filter (see GetRuntimeCompilerFilterOption). So there's a precedent that we will have to resurrect if we want to overrule it.

FYI: the main reason we went for parsing the compiler options for the compiler filter is that we did not want to duplicate an option. In the case of debuggable, we could drop the debuggable option to the compiler.

this could potentially match other options if any are added.

(This is a reason why I think searching through compiler options is a bad idea).

Sure, luckily we do control all of this.

This seems wrong. class_linker_ is not created until line 1207 in this function but SetJavaDebuggable does a call into it.

Good catch, I've added a started_ test.

this function is called prior to class_linker_ being set.
