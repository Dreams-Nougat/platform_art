I am okay with the change, but the position of this VLOG and message seem a bit ad-hoc. How about logging this at the start of this method (assuming you had no specific reason to put this here), and make the message a bit more general, something like

"Running dex2oat (parent PID = xxxx)"

That way, we don't fragment our messaging, since we can put other information in the same line later if needed.
