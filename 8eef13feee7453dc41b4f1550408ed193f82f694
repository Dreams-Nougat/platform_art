We discussed the same change here yesterday :-)

The message would have read:

"Flush updated JIT code into shared memory before invalidating instruction pipelines on active cores with mprotect(RWX->RW)."

This perhaps conveys the concern more concisely? The change is making absolutely clear there's no new code data in the store buffer before doing mprotect(). WDYT?

The test should be on device unless the host referred to has ARM architecture cpu (?).
