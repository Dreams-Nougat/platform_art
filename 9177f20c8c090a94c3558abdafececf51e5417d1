The intent of this code was to support stepping out of an interpreted method into its compiled caller method. Does this CL still supports that?

I have implemented step-out by adding a new InterpreterWillBeExited event to the InstrumentationListener and sending that event from artQuickToInterpreterBridge before returning.
In response to that event the debugger will request a frame deoptimization by setting the deoptimization exception, thus we will be able to step into the upcall that was compiled originally.
