surprised we don't already have a helper for this. You could add one, pretty sure we have this pattern in other places as well.

not for this CL, but maybe we should introduce a typedef for this and use consistently across the code. wdyt?

If I remember right a class with verification errors will not be marked resolved. Is this the logic that we want here?

consider adding a helper. The logging makes the logic harder to read.

Each of the inner methods (e.g. VerifyFields) only print the first error. I think we should be consistent and abort if one of the stages fail.

Or... we could gather all of them and in a list of errors and print them at the end, which would be better for debug mode.
