How about DEBUG_JAVA_DEBUGGABLE? (to make it consistent with DEBUG_NATIVE_DEBUGGABLE).

I honestly think that would be confusing since we already support java debuggers. This name says exactly what it ensures.

Honestly I don't really like the name native_debuggable either. Both are extremely unhelpful names.

DEBUGGABLE has been the name all along. You might argue you could make deoptimizable/debuggable different, but this isn't the path we're going: an app is either debuggable or not.

So having DEBUGGABLE in the name is desirable IMO. An other option is DEBUGGABLE_APP.

What is the difference with IsDebuggable?

IsDebuggable is based on the primary oat file only.

That's an implementation problem. The goal of IsDebuggable it to know whether the app is debuggable, which is what looks to me you're also trying to say with IsFullyDeoptable.

I don't understand why we need another option?

We cannot have this set for run-tests without adding an option.

--debuggable is supposed to be that option.
