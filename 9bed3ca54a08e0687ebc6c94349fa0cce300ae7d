Isn't that known from the start? It'd be good to avoid the lock, so that you can also avoid it in GetDexFileDeps.

Why is it ok to have *all* array classes (and according to your comments synthesized classes too) say they're part of the classpath? Maybe expand the comment.

So I guess the dependencies of that dex file will be guaranteed to be in its associated vdex?

If you make GetDexFileDeps lock free, you can make this the first thing (add a helper btw, as this check is done my a few methods) and avoid taking the lock. You can also move the IsInClassPath check out of the lock.

You mean "compiled" here right? There's something very confusing in this file around:
- classes in dex files being compiled
- classes in dex file from the classpath

It seems those sets are different right? (see your IsInClasspath implementation : return (GetDexFileDeps(*dex_file) == nullptr);).

It would be good to also document what those sets of dex files are.

Iffy, what does that mean if this is null?
