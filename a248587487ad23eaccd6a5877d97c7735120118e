Won't this go wrong if somebody now switches the flag to true?

I think this should just always be true, and hopefully the linker throws away dead code?

You are correct. It does complain about that case (and I had to bump the deviceFrameSizeLimit to 2400 in art.go to support it).

To support true (which was already broken), I also needed to add a missing entry for CHA (class hierarchy analysis). Once I verify my change locally, I will reupload here.
