Do we expect to add stuff at the end of this function (or its equivalent in the other ARM code generator)? It's true that some of the explicit Release() calls I have added are, strictly speaking, unnecessary, but there are code generator calls after them, so I have done it defensively (to make the code more robust against future changes).

Does the vixl disassembler always print both Rd and Rn, even for the SUB (immediate) encoding T2?

No, but I have to recheck if this rule works for the current backend (it works for the VIXL backend, since that's what I have been mainly interested in) - thanks for the reminder!
