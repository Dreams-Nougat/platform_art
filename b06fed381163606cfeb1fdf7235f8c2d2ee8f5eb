This looks very special cased. Should we consider loop folding instead? For this example folding the first iteration would do the trick.

I am not sure I agree it is very special cased (it is common to have induction here), but if you are opposed to this, I am happy to abandon as well. Folding is something I plan in the  loop optimizer (but that runs after licm, unless I do some licm at the same time in loop opt)

How many non-zero values do you want to tolerate?

  do {
    i += 2;
    j -= 3;
    k += 5;
  } while (a[i][j ^= 3][k ^= 7] == 0);  // j and k are not induction variables.

42 :-)

But you raise a good point on capping the number somehow. Or are you saying you don't like this optimization at all? Then also no hard feelings....

The optimization is fine but we should cap this.
(Alternatively, extend stack maps to allow "value_from_some_location+adjustment".)

Ok, will add the cap. And as usual you have brilliant suggestions, I like the idea of putting that in the map, avoiding computation and probably even code size compared to this approach. Made a TODO on that.
