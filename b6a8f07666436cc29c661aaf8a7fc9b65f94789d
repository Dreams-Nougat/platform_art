I see. I think I understand a little more about why this is called a "callsite transform". We copy the arguments exactly to the emulated call frame and then perform all argument conversions in Java. That said, I didn't see any code in the libcore change to perform argument conversions for the non var-args arguments. Did i miss something ?
