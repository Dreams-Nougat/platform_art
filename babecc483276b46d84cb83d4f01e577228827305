Is this logic being preserved?

Yes,

collector_type_ has the default set in XGcOption constructor
background_collector_type has the default set in BackgroundGcOption constructor
interpreter_only has the default set in runtime_options.def

Basically primitives have their defaults set directly in runtime_options.def and everything else is in the default constructor of the type.

We could do it all in runtime_options.def but then the default values become many lines instead of 1 line, and T{} no longer reflects defaults which seems counter-intuitive. Either way is fine with me.

I see.

I see UseTLAB is a Unit type. How would temporarily I change it to hard-code/override use_tlab_ = true now like I was able to here before?
