I like the new name, it certainly conveys better what is being tested here. One question, between L524 and L532, we have a runtime, but no callbacks yet. So, the usage in mutex thinks it is *not* safe to call abort yet (no callback yet). Does that mean that the fatal logs in Init() are not handled as fatal? Does it make sense to move setting the callback up for that reason?

OK, I agree and have moved it up.  I don't like the way the singleton pattern is being implemented here (revealing the new Runtime instance to clients before Init is finished), but that's a topic for a future CL.
