These test helpers are useful even if they aren't being used [currently], they aren't exactly trivial to write.

I'd rather not keep unused code lying around in the codebase. Note that there were no new usages outside of the lambda code in the year since they were introduced.

That said, this is back now, because I brought back support for ExperimentalFlags (and the associated test).

Why? You're adding new experimental features right now, and Nicolas wanted them to be guarded behind a flag in the first place.

Well, I wouldn't call them experimental since we've committed to shipping them (though the design might change over time).

I did intend on guarding them with their own flag until work was complete, but It's probably better to reuse what you've done.

Resurrected.

You may not want to remove this, it was put in here for a reason, and that's to make development a lot simpler because you can implement the new bytecodes into the interpreter without also implementing full verifier support for it.

At the same time the instructions would be completely usable from run-test, dalvikvm etc.

Depending on how complicated it is to correctly verify the new bytecodes, it may not be trivial to do it within the same CL.

Sure - might come in handy.
