I don't really expect to see this in the wild, it's too unlikely. But I'm fixing this for the sake of correctness even in the most unlikely situations. Callers do not expect a pending exception when they see non-null return value, so they would probably crash when they try to continue their work, most likely in a call to Thread::AssertNoPendingException().
