Should we add a flag in HLoopInformation and compute it in PopulateLoop? This seems generally useful to know.

I like that idea. Also about having early exits. Right now that is an expensive operation that we do in BCE and LoopOpt. Keeping the flags up to date after changes may be a challenge though...

Not really? I think i'd avoid this helper method, and just inline the !Contains in HasNoExitEdges.
