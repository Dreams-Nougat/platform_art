Now that $t0 is an argument register, maybe we should use $t8 instead.
(Also for consistency with the corresponding RESTORE macro.)

The entrypoint could call another helper function to extract the shorty and check it but that would slow things down.

Removing the "TODO" is a strange way of addressing my comment... never mind.

Sorry, from your comment I concluded that there wasn't anything necessary to do and my comment wasn't really needed (at least in its original form). Removing my comment was nonetheless a change and so I marked the removal as "Done". If you think there may be a use of another comment here, let me know what it should be. Again, sorry, I should've asked first.
