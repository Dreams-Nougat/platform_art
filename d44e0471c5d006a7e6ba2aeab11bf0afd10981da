Why can't we just change JAVAC to include source/target globally?

That is also an option, and probably a better option. I have uploaded https://android-review.googlesource.com/275656, which updates JAVAC in the run-test script when Jack is not used.

Another option will be to have the run-test script use an already set JAVAC environment variable, like it does for DX, JACK, etc.
