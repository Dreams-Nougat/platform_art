VerifyInvocationArgs() can fail for a range of reasons (resolution, permission, argument checks, possibly more). An earlier soft error message provides that detail.

The code now converts a potentially soft error on the VerifyInvocationArgs() to a hard error. As far as I know none of the soft errors would be recoverable for invoke-polymorphic. Does this seem reasonable?
