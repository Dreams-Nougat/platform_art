This script only runs on the host (see line 1 where its specified to be bash).

What does the path look like for when it runs on the device? Shouldn't it also includde /data/tmp? I'd be more worried about PATH_MAX in that case. That checking seems like it should go into run-test-jar .

NAME_MAX is for the filename size (basename whatever)

PATH_MAX is for the path size (full path) and its usually 1024
