Is it better to use a different type? In the future, this is likely to allow accidental access through the normal standard library mechanism, which may rely on locks instead, and thus wouldn't provide atomicity with respect to these.

In future, when normal 16-byte atomics are supported by the standard library, this workaround should go away. There is no reason why we should have 2 different ways to performing the same operation.
