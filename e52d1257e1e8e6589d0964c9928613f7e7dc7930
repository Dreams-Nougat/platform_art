__ Cmp(op1_reg, 0);

and get rid of `op2_reg`.

I couldn't find anything in two instructions. Here are a couple other possibilities.

Using only one 'conditional' instruction (same as suggested before, but here we don't have integer overflows annoying us):

    __ Cmp(op1_reg, 0);
    __ Asr(out_reg, out_reg, 31);
    __ Cinc(out_reg, out_reg, gt);

Or using only arithmetic operations (we would need to not specify kNoOutputOverlap for this one):

    __ Neg(out_reg, op1_reg);
    __ Lsr(out_reg, out_reg, 31);
    __ Orr(out_reg, out_reg, Operand(op1_reg, ASR, 31));

I benchmarked the three routines on A53 and A57 in a tight loop, and they time exactly the same. I would have a preference for the `Cinc`, but sticking to yours is good as it mirrors the `compare()` code.

Let's keep the CMP+CSET/GT+CINV/LT here.

For Thumb2 int, maybe

    CMP in, #1             // 16-bit if op1 is low reg.
    ASR out, in, #31       // 32-bit, don't want to set flags (kCcKeep).
    ADC(S?) out, out, out  // 16-bit if out is low reg (kCcDontCare).

with kNoOutputOverlap or

    ASR(S?) out, in, #31   // 16-bit if both are low regs.
    CMP in, #1             // 16-bit if op1 is low reg.
    ADC(S?) out, out, out  // 16-bit if out is low reg.

with kOutputOverlap. (Or we could specify kNoOutputOverlap and select from the above depending on the registers we actually get.)

Ah, did not know that would work too. Changed.
Thanks.
