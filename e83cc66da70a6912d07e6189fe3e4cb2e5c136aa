I think this comment should be rephrased.  I added it in other code generators because the hidden register was set early and could have been clobbered by other operations before the call instruction at the end of VisitInvokeInterface (I think this was the source of one bug).  Here that risk is non-existent, as there is no instruction between the move to the hidden reg and the BLX instruction.

Could this be moved inside class `FieldAccessCallingConventionARMVIXL` below to reduce the scope of this statement?  Our C++ style discourages `using` directives in headers.
