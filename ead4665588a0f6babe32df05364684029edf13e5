nit: or you could just use "bool oat;" and "-verbose:oat" to avoid the need for the clarification.

I'm not sure what the current fashion is. I thought it was const references or non-const pointers.

seems like workarounds like this should have a comment? Do we have an idea why or is the reason lost to time?

It compiles fine on my machine without the pragmas.

Andreas, it looks like you wrote these lines originally as part of https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/113068/. Do remember any special reason why these lines are needed? If not, then I'll remove them.

do we use ALOG directly? isn't that the only reason for defining a TAG?

I see, this is different than ALOG TAG's which are "strings". I think this is just more reason to rename to "oat"

oat data begin check was first before there was patching. it was needed to cover changes to the boot.oat layout requiring a recompile, even if checksum didn't change.

patch delta was added later. one could imagine the boot being relocated but having the same data begin and checksum, right? so that is needed as a separate check?

If this is the case, it sounds like the check against oat_data_begin should be part of the checksum test, not the relocation test (in other words, it should be moved to 'GivenOatFileIsOutOfDate'.

I wonder if this means there's a bug in the old code. What if you have a PIC oat file where boot.oat layout has changed but the checksum hasn't? Is there a way to write a test of boot.oat layout changing without the checksum changing?

I hate to say this, but I was thinking of OatFileManager as more of the singleton and the owner of the ClassLinker::oat_files_ etc, perhaps the static members of here could be there.

I realized there would have to be some helper class like the OatFileManager here, we have traditionally called these something like OatFileReference or OatFileHelper. I'll ignore that for the purposes of the review, we can chat about names separately.

Thoughts on naming:
 "OatFileManager" - doesn't quite fit, because the class doesn't manage the oat files after they are loaded.
 "OatFileHelper" - apparently has legacy connotations, and I think it's vague. What does it help with? Could be reading, writing, formatting, verifying, accessing or any number of other things. I fear this sounds appealing from the context of choosing the name for this class, but doesn't make sense in the general context of art class names.
 "OatFileReference" - but this isn't a reference to an Oat file.

How about "OatFileAssistant"? It's suitably vague, without connotations that I know of, and if you want an OatFileManager eventually, it makes sense for the Manager to have an Assistant.

for these, it is often clear to just use the constant name such as kUpToDate so that searches will find the comment as well.

that should be a misconfiguration, the BOOTCLASSPATH is expected to be the same for all ISAs. In theory something could try to validate this. If that is your goal, we should probably be more explicit about what is to be done.

seems like it should go up with the more general description. any reason it shouldn't be an error since if the lock's are nested, the unlocks might be a problem.

is it possible for the odex to be out of date? because we validate that the system odex agrees with the system dex file?

system odex wasn't checked before. I think because there was no way out, as any apk/jar would have been stripped.

on a casual read, these seem to be opposites, I assume the difference is patching case. can this be clearer?

probably we can just treat them as absolute with the leading char removed. this might fix art/tools/art and shouldn't be a security issue if we insist they are absolute in installd

I believe dalvik sniffed out thing using extension where art looks at file magic more. that said for /system odex files, it harder to support short because things would collide. so perhaps we just don't support /system odex file short names, but allow it for other uses.
