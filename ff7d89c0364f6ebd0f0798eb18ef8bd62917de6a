Do you plan on implementing them?

Or simplifying if the argument is a single-character const-string?

I had no direct plans, but that is an interesting idea. Note that we have three uses of intrinsics: 

(1) ones that lower methods to HIR (unreachable)
(2) ones that are unimplemented, but convey interesting properties to compiler (unimplemented)
(3) ones that are implemented on some/call archs in better native code

I was really using it for (2) here, but we can always move those to (3)

I hope this is how it is supposed to go.

PTAL
