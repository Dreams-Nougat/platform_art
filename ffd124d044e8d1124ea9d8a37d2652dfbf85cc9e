This seems like a hack, I'd rather have each test directory have a file that can check whether or not it's allowed to run based on the current run-test flags.

Thoughts anyone else?

I think for now make system decides what can be run in what configuration. I'll see if I can integrate bisection search with the make path and handle those tests there.

This seems like a hack, perhaps we can generalize this?

One way might be to have each test directory have a file (e.g. check_if_enabled) that will receive the args and then return either 0 or 1 if the test should be enabled or not.

And even that might not be that great because if you could just have a better generalization on why these tests fail for bisection search then we wouldn't have to have test-specific logic.

Thoughts anyone else?

It was tricky for example because run-test-jar runs on host, but should collect output from device. Fixed.
