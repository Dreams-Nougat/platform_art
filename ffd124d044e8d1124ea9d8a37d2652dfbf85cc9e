This seems like a hack, I'd rather have each test directory have a file that can check whether or not it's allowed to run based on the current run-test flags.

Thoughts anyone else?

This seems like a hack, perhaps we can generalize this?

One way might be to have each test directory have a file (e.g. check_if_enabled) that will receive the args and then return either 0 or 1 if the test should be enabled or not.

And even that might not be that great because if you could just have a better generalization on why these tests fail for bisection search then we wouldn't have to have test-specific logic.

Thoughts anyone else?
